# 3D Truss Solver

A desktop application built with VB.NET for modeling and analyzing 3D truss structures. The tool enables users to define truss geometry, apply loads and supports, and compute:

- Axial forces in truss members  
- Stresses and strains  
- Nodal displacements (deflection)  
- Reaction forces at supports  

## Features

- Intuitive model creation interface  
- Support for 3D node and element input  
- Load and boundary condition application  
- Static analysis using the Finite Element Method  
- Contour visualization of results (Displacement, Stress, Strain, Member Force, and Reaction Force)

## Getting Started

To use the software:

1. Download the executable (`.exe`) from the `Portable_version` folder.
2. Download example models from the `Example_models` folder.
3. Run the `.exe` file and load an example or create a new model.
